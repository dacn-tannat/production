# Production Deployment Guide

## Steps to Deploy the Source Code in Production

### 1. Clone the Source Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dacn-tannat/cse-lbds-server.git
```

### 2. Organize the Directory Structure

Ensure the directory structure is as follows:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ production/
    â”œâ”€â”€ client/         # May need to rename from cse-lbds-client
    â”œâ”€â”€ server/         # May need to rename from cse-lbds-server
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile
    â”œâ”€â”€ nginx/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default.conf
    â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
    â”œâ”€â”€ init-letsencrypt.sh
    â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### 3. Navigate to the Production Directory

```bash
cd production
```

### 4. Generate SSL Certificates (First-Time Setup Only)

```bash
chmod +x init-letsencrypt.sh
bash init-letsencrypt.sh
```

Note:

- Make sure that the value of the `staging` variable in line 10 is `0` in the production environment.
- Also, line 39 to the end of the file must be uncommented.
- If successful, a `certbot/` directory will be created within `production/`.

### 5. Start the System

```bash
docker-compose -p cse-lbds up -d
```

This will start the entire system using `docker-compose.yml`.

### Notes

Happy Deploying! ðŸš€
